# Introduction to Web Development with MERN Stack - 3 Day Training

Welcome to the Introduction to Web Development with MERN Stack training program! In this three-day workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of web development using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. By the end of this training, you'll have a strong foundation in building full-stack web applications.

## Project Structure


This project is structured into two main folders: backend and frontend.

### Backend

The backend folder contains all the server-side code for our application. Here, we utilize Node.js with Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests and interact with the database. MongoDB is used as our database management system.

### Frontend

The frontend folder holds the client-side code of our application. We utilize React.js library to create dynamic user interfaces and manage the application's state.

## Workshop Schedule

### Day 1: Setting Up the Environment and Backend Development
- Morning Session: Introduction to MERN Stack, setting up Node.js and MongoDB, initializing a new Express.js project.
- Afternoon Session: Creating RESTful APIs with Express.js, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Day 2: Frontend Development with React.js
- Morning Session: Introduction to React.js, setting up a React project using create-react-app, understanding components and props.
- Afternoon Session: Managing state with React hooks, handling user input and form submissions, consuming APIs in React.

### Day 3: Full-Stack Development and CRUD Workshop
- Morning Session: Integrating frontend with backend, connecting React components to backend APIs, implementing user authentication.
- Afternoon Session: Hands-on CRUD workshop - participants will work on a project implementing CRUD operations on both frontend and backend, with guidance from instructors.

## CRUD Workshop Details

In the CRUD workshop, participants will work on a mini-project where they will build a simple task management application. The application will allow users to perform CRUD operations on tasks, including creating new tasks, viewing existing tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks.

## Workshop Tasks:

- Setup: Initialize a new Express.js project for the backend and a React.js project for the frontend.
- Backend CRUD Operations: Implement API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks in the backend.
- Frontend Integration: Create React components for displaying tasks, creating new tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks. Connect these components to the backend APIs.
- User Authentication (Optional): Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure the CRUD operations.

## Conclusion
We hope you find this three-day training program valuable and enriching. By the end of this workshop, you'll have gained practical experience in building full-stack web applications with the MERN stack and be ready to take your web development skills to the next level. Enjoy the journey of learning and creating!
